1- clone repo
2- split termainals - one for frontend and one for backend
3- npm i in both
4- npm start in frontend
5- node app.js in backend - only do it once as it seeds the databse with 3 feature products at first. Running it again and again will require to empty products from databse

Approaches:
- Used Sequalize ORM
- Tailwind csss for styling
- MySQL database for storage

key functionalities:
- Created own feature product api
- Star a product and store it along with user details
- update products price every 24 hours - logically
- kept in mind the preferences - tailwind, sql etc.
